  # Resource Planning Application

  A comprehensive resource planning application built with React, AG-Grid, Prisma ORM, and SQLite database. This application allows you to manage projects, resources, rate cards, and create detailed resource plans with weekly allocations.

  ## Features

  ### Database Integration
  - **SQLite Database**: Persistent data storage using Prisma ORM
  - **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects with settings
  - **Resource Lists**: Manage available resources with roles, names, and rates
  - **Rate Cards**: Import and manage rate cards from Excel files with regional pricing
  - **Resource Plans**: Create detailed resource plans with variable weekly allocations
  - **Weekly Allocations**: Track resource allocation percentages by week

  ### AG-Grid Integration
  - **Editable Grids**: Inline editing for all data fields
  - **Dynamic Columns**: Variable number of weeks in resource planning
  - **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic cost and effort calculations
  - **Excel Import**: Import rate cards from Excel files
  - **Sorting and Filtering**: Advanced grid features for data management

  ### API Endpoints
  - **Project Management**: CRUD operations for projects
  - **Resource Lists**: Manage resource availability
  - **Rate Cards**: Handle rate card data and Excel imports
  - **Resource Plans**: Manage planning data with weekly allocations
  - **Weekly Allocations**: Track resource allocation by week

  ## Database Schema

  ### Tables
  1. **Project**: Project configuration and settings
  2. **Rate_card**: Rate card data imported from Excel
  3. **Resource_list**: Available resources for projects
  4. **Resource_plan**: Planning table with variable weeks
  5. **Weekly_allocations**: Resource allocation by week

  ### Relationships
  - Projects have many Rate Cards, Resource Lists, and Resource Plans
  - Resource Plans have many Weekly Allocations
  - All relationships use proper foreign keys with cascade deletes
